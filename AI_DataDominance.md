# DataDominance - What it is and How it Works? 
### In a nutshell: More users, customers, installs >> More data >> More AI capability >> Better product >> More users, customers, installs.
### Macy’s, Exxon Mobil, and Wells Fargo have access to vastly more data than most businesses that have ever existed – why aren’t they AI innovators?
* Valuable : Valuable – It can enable beneficial outcomes for users or for business processes.
* Exclusivity and Access – Few other organizations have it, few organizations have access to as much of it.

## Enabling Factors
* Technical AI Skills : Data scientists, data engineers, machine learning engineers, AI-savvy programmers of all kinds.
* Business AI Context : Business leaders and functional team members (in marketing, in customer service, in inventory, etc) who understand roughly what AI can do, 
where it can be used, and what problems it can be applied to.
* Data Infrastructure : The right data is stored in the right formats. Data from different sources is “harmonized” so that it can be combined, searched, or used 
to train different kinds of AI models. Important data is treated with care, data is a strategic consideration across business functions.
* Enterprise leaders are the last group to the party. Most enterprise leaders see AI as another kind of IT tool, or as a means to automate processes and gain 
efficiencies. Enterprises in manufacturing, pharma, banking, and other sectors are still mostly oblivious to the kind of “economic moat” that can be created by 
artificial intelligence in the right application.

## Data Dominance in Action - Land, Command, Expand
* Land – Determine a critical business opportunity or challenge, and the critical data that would help to improve the business processes around that opportunity or
challenge, or improve the customer/user experience of those who would potentially benefit from it. Collect as many data streams as possible and test how artificial 
intelligence can use those streams to improve efficiency or user experience. Learn and iterate, determine what kinds of data, and what kinds of algorithms, can 
deliver value. Focus on scaling access to data streams (acquiring users, retaining users).
Note: A “user” could be the user of an app (such as Facebook Messenger), a customer (Amazon’s customers), or a client who installs software or hardware that 
collects data (industrial IoT applications, like Uptake).

* Command – Using lessons learned from data access, and using increasing access to torrents of new data, own your position in the market by being able to offer a 
better product, or a more profitable process. Lock in existing users with data-based benefits they couldn’t get elsewhere.
Example: InsideSales is a CRM company focused on sales rep activity. If InsideSales can use data from its users to help enable its new customers to have more 
productive sales staff just by using the software (say, by knowing which opportunities are most likely to close, when to reach out to new clients, etc), then it 
can potentially dominate the market.

* Expand – Using profits, data streams, and locked-in users, expand to solve adjacent business problems or opportunities, by finding new kinds of data to collect 
from one’s user base, and delivering more value to users in doing so.Amazon went from recommending purchases online to recommending purchases from in-home Alexa 
devices. Facebook went from owning social networking “stickiness”, to owning the communication channels that friends use outside of the platform (WhatsApp, 
Facebook Messenger).
